          <img class = "cs" src = "battleship.PNG">
          <p> this class was interesting, but i remember spending
            almost all my free time learning how to code. now that i understand
            runtime. the code i wrote in my final homework above is lowkey a nightmare.
            now that i'm taking data structures, i am literally sobbing at the fact
            how much easier cs1114 was in comparison. the jump between the two classes
            is insane. lecture is also so different. i loved cs1114 lectures; they
            always had step-by-step presentations. i got an A in this class, and would i retake it?
            probably bc it was a lot of fun plus i met some cool ppl in that class.

         <img class = "cs" src = "eg1004.PNG">
         <p> not gonna lie, the lab reports for this class was hell for me. i remember
           also spending all my free time writing them. otherwise, i had so much fun in
           this class because i met so many cool people. i got along with my sldp group,
           and professor ingrid wrote me a rec to become a TA. (now i am one for EG1004!)
           it's really funny to reflect on my experience as a student because now i get
           along with her as a friend, as well as other TAs. this class is now called
           eg1004, but i took it when it was 3 credits. lolol oh well! would i retake the class?
           of course i would!! the only thing that would be a bit weird is that it's a first
           year class, but i'm no longer a first year, so i would likely not relate to the experiences
           of the other students in the class.

         <img class = "cs" src = "idp.png">
         <p> ideation and prototyping was such a fun class! i loved my professor (kathleen).
           she gave great feedback, and she also gave the most fun of projects to challenge
           our creativity. constant output was the most interesting assignment because it essentially
           gave me a reason to consistently make something new, something i've neglected myself to <!DOCTYPE html>
           for years. it gave me perspective that i can definitely be creative and artistic each week if i disciplined myself more. the
           quality of the projects definitely varied, but i learned more about my realistic capabilities
           and what i can accomplish in a certain time constraint. i would love to take this class again
           if i were able to!!
